          <hr color="grey" />
          My goal has remained entact since I first started creating; to change
          the world.
          <br />
          While working towards this goal, I hope to serve as a catalyst to
          bring forth healing, growth, expression and love in individuals.
          <br />
          For those not ready or interested in change, at the very least, I
          strive to take individuals to another world with my creations.
